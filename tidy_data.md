# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

This project is part of the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course. The goal is to prepare a tidy dataset from the UCI HAR Dataset.

## Files
- `run_analysis.R`: R script that performs data cleaning and generates a tidy dataset.
- `tidy_data.txt`: Final tidy dataset containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- `CodeBook.md`: Explains the variables in the dataset, units, and transformations.
- `README.md`: Describes the project and instructions.

## Instructions
1. Download the dataset from [UCI HAR Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
2. Place the dataset in your working directory.
3. Run `run_analysis.R` to generate the tidy dataset.
